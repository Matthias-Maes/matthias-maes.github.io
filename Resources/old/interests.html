                <h3>Tech & Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Perhaps one of my biggest interests next to game development, is technology!
                    <br>I try to keep up with the latest advancements in the tech industry and love to go hands-on with the newest technologies.
                    I'm always eager to learn new skills and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.

                    </div>
                    <br>In my spare time, I like a good challenge! That's why I enjoy programming with Python or making websites so much.
                    It's a way to express myself, find my limits and extend them. It's the next best thing after game development/production for me to combine my creative side with my technical skills.

                <h3>Family, Friends & Hobby's</h3>
                <p>
                    I love playing basketball, which I've played on a competitive level for many years of which a few as team leader, and volleyball in my free time to blow off some steam.
                    Spending time with my friends is something I can always enjoy! Travelling together, doing activities...

                <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
                <p>
                    Gaming to me is not just having fun with friends, it's also a source of inspiration for my creative work. Here are my favorite games that have shaped my perspective as a developer:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Minecraft</strong> - A sandbox for endless creativity, sparking my interest in modular game systems.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In this game I made a game I called "Maze Bosses" and it was the beginning of my game development journey. Playing Minecraft with my friends makes me forget about this world.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Assetto Corsa Competizione</strong> - It's a racing game that challenges me to think cleverly in terms of balance and physics.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As a hobby, I've played Assetto Corsa Competizione for some time with a frined and it has always been a fun game to play. Playing it also just makes me forget time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
